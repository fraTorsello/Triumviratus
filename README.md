# ‚ôî **Triumviratus** ‚ôî
*Triumviratus 2.0* is a sophisticated UCI chess engine that employs advanced techniques, including bitboard representation and powerful algorithms such as alpha-beta pruning with Negamax, complemented by a quiescence search. The engine has evolved from its previous version, *Triumviratus 1.0*, which drew inspiration from "*Vice" by Bluefever*. Notably, version 1.0 lacked the bitboard representation that is now a key feature in the upgraded *Triumviratus 2.0*, enhancing its overall efficiency and capabilities in chess analysis and gameplay.   

The name *"Triumviratus"* is derived from the concept of a triumvirate, symbolizing a group of three individuals. In this context, it pays homage to the passion for chess that unites me and my two brothers (much like the classical concept of a triumvirate). As such, *Triumviratus* embodies the collaborative spirit and shared dedication of three minds harmoniously working together.

The invaluable lessons and techniques distilled from this series have played a pivotal role in cultivating a profound understanding of the fundamental aspects of chess engine programming. Additionally, the fundamentals of chess engine programming have been further enriched through the examination of the development of "Vice" by Bluefever Software and their accompanying YouTube video series. The insights gained from studying "Vice" have provided valuable perspectives, contributing to the refinement and enhancement of Triumviratus.

Special thanks to Chessprogramming Wiki for providing clear and insightful explanations that have greatly assisted in understanding various aspects of chess engines development.

It's worth noting that certain aspects of the code, particularly the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) communication part and the implementation of *get_time_ms()*, have been forked from the codebase of **Vice**. This collaborative approach not only acknowledges the influence of Bluefever Software's work but also highlights the cooperative nature of chess engine development, where ideas and implementations are shared and built upon within the community.

# üìà Project Status

## üîë Key Features 
- **Bitboard Representation:**
  Harnessing the efficiency and speed of bitboards for chess board representation, *Triumviratus* adopts a cutting-edge approach to optimize both move generation and evaluation processes, achieving unparalleled performance in the realm of chess engines. Bitboards, a compact and highly efficient data structure, empower Triumviratus to analyze chess positions with speed. Each chess piece type, as well as important game state information, is encoded using a set of bits, allowing for rapid operations.

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning with Negamax:**
  *Triumviratus* strategically utilizes the alpha-beta pruning algorithm, seamlessly integrated with the Negamax search algorithm. This synergistic combination enhances the engine's capacity to efficiently explore and evaluate potential moves, resulting in a significant boost to strategic decision-making.

- **Quiescence Search:**
  *Triumviratus* ensures precise move selection through its quiescence search, a strategic exploration of variations in positions where the game state is relatively quiet. This approach not only leads to more reliable and robust gameplay but is also instrumental in mitigating the horizon effect.

- **NNUE for Position Evaluation:**
  *Triumviratus* ventures beyond conventional methods by integrating NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network) for position evaluation, a cutting-edge technology that imparts a layer of sophistication to the engine's ability to assess and understand the complexities of chess positions. This state-of-the-art approach, akin to that employed by Stockfish, significantly refines Triumviratus' strategic prowess and elevates its overall performance in the dynamic landscape of chess.

- **Move Ordering:**
  Implementing move ordering techniques to enhance the efficiency of the search algorithm and prioritize the most promising moves early in the search.

- **PV Table (Principal Variation Table):**
  *Triumviratus* strategically employs a Principal Variation (PV) table to store and retrieve principal variations, enhancing the efficiency of its search algorithm by preventing redundant evaluations of the same position. This sophisticated mechanism ensures that the engine optimally navigates through the vast chess search space, avoiding unnecessary recalculations and contributing to faster and more streamlined decision-making.

- **Null Move Pruning:**
  *Triumviratus* incorporates null move pruning as a strategic optimization in its search process. This technique expedites the search by efficiently identifying positions where making no move leads to a favorable outcome. By temporarily simulating a scenario where the side to move skips a turn, Triumviratus efficiently prunes branches of the search tree where such a null move does not lead to a significant disadvantage. This approach aids in accelerating the overall search process, enabling the engine to focus on more promising lines of play and improving its computational efficiency.

- **Late Move Reduction:**
  *Triumviratus* employs late move reduction as a strategic enhancement in its search algorithm. This optimization involves reducing the search depth for less promising moves late in the search process. By intelligently scaling back the exploration of certain branches, Triumviratus streamlines its search, allocating more computational resources to promising lines of play. This approach contributes to a more efficient search, allowing the engine to prioritize the analysis of potentially impactful moves and enhancing its overall decision-making capabilities.

- **Transposition Table with Zobrist Hashing:**
  *Triumviratus* enhances search efficiency by implementing a transposition table. This table stores previously evaluated positions utilizing Zobrist hashing, a technique that minimizes redundancy in evaluations. Zobrist hashing assigns unique keys to chess positions, allowing Triumviratus to quickly identify and retrieve information from the transposition table. By avoiding redundant evaluations of positions, this approach significantly improves overall performance, making the engine more adept at navigating complex chess scenarios with greater speed and precision.

- **Aspiration Window:**
  *Triumviratus* implements an aspiration window as a strategic tool in its search process. This optimization involves focusing the search on a narrow range of evaluation values, allowing the engine to explore variations within a specific target.

## ü™Ñ Magic Bitboard Move Generation:

Triumviratus incorporates magic bitboards into its move generation process, enhancing the efficiency of move generation. Magic bitboards are a sophisticated technique that involves using precomputed "magic" numbers to efficiently generate sliding piece moves (such as those of bishops and rooks) on a chess board. By leveraging this approach, Triumviratus accelerates the generation of legal moves, contributing to an overall improvement in the engine's speed and responsiveness during the search process. This optimized move generation allows the engine to explore a broader range of candidate moves within the available time frame, enhancing its decision-making capabilities and tactical awareness.

# üöÄ Future Roadmap 
*Triumviratus* is an evolving project with future updates planned to include the implementation of multithreading. This enhancement will enable the engine to harness the power of parallel processing, significantly improving its performance and speed.
